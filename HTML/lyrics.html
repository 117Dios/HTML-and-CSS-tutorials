        <pre>
        Red stain on the grain of the timber
        Obscured in the trees and the towns
        There's a sinister scent on the wind
        Our time's gonna come around
        The red sun is going down

        And there's a devil inside of us all now
        There's a giant to bring to the ground
        He's taking us out when he falls
        Our time's gonna come around
        The red sun is going down

        And there's a price to pay
        For all that we have done
        Turn my eyes away
        And watch the setting sun

        Grey ghosts in the smoke of the campfires
        They weep and they wail with no sound
        They darken the lights and the lamps
        Our time's gonna come around
        The red sun is going down

        There's a sting on the gasp of my breath now
        There's a mark on the wrists ever bound
        Raw rings in the cycle of death
        Our time's gonna come around
        The red sun is going down

        And there's a price to pay
        For all that we have done
        Turn my eyes away
        And watch the setting sun

        Now loyalty's a pistol
        And my heart is full of holes
        I'm bleeding out my spirit
        I'm breathing out my soul

        Now loyalty's a pistol
        And my heart is full of holes
        I'm bleeding out my spirit
        Breathing out my soul

        Our days are almost over
        Times have changed around these parts
        There ain't no more cowboys
        Only men with violent hearts

        And there's a price to pay
        For all that we have done
        Turn my eyes away
        And watch the setting sun
